Creating Vivid Visualizations with Machine Learning and Math: Activation Maximization Through Gradient Ascent

## What is Deep Dream, and how can a computer "Dream"?
As image recognition, object detection and segmentation neural networks get more advanced, they suffer more and more from a lack of interpretability. Deep Dream performs Activation Maximization, also known as Feature Visualization, in order to reveal the features that a given convolutional neural network is looking for. By maximally activating the brain of the model, we get vivid visualizations of the learned representations.
