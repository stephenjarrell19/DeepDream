Creating Vivid Visualizations with Machine Learning and Math: Activation Maximization Through Gradient Ascent

## What is Deep Dream, and how can a computer "Dream"?

As image recognition, object detection and segmentation neural networks get more advanced, they suffer more and more from a lack of interpretability. Interpretability is a critical and often overlooked aspect of Machine Learning; how can we trust the models we build? The Deep Dream algorithm offers a growing solution to the poor interpretability of neural networks by shining a light into the notorious "black box" of these models. 

Deep Dream performs Activation Maximization, also known as Feature Visualization, in order to reveal the features that a given convolutional neural network is looking for. By maximally activating the brain of the model, we get vivid visualizations of the learned representations.
